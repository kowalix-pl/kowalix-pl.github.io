“You may be a puzzle, but I like the way the parts fit." – Frank Sinatra

The above quote may describe the thoughts and feelings that you have towards your significant other or, as it is in my case, it can describe your journey towards becoming a full-stack software developer at FLS. 

  In module 2 of the program I learned about the second, important part of the software development puzzle - the data structures. I got a good introduction to  Model - View - Controller  which represents business data and logic of the program. The MVC is a backbone of a design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces. It divides program logic into 3 distinctive interrelated elements and  is based on the “separation of concern” principle, meaning that each component of the system holds a different responsibility. 

 #Model - reflects real world situations. In the example of my portfolio project which is a database of albums, my models consist of Album and the User. Those objects store data retrieved from the database.

#View- Is the user interface. It displays model data to users and allows them to modify the data using CRUD models.

#Controller - Connects views with models by handling user requests.

I implemented MVC principle combined with functionality provided by Sinatra gem to build my first web application in Ruby. Sinatra is a DSL that automated and simplified processes related to creation of my web app. Named after the famous singer gem, used routes to determine how to handle web-server requests.  It helped me build an application that allows users to create, store, update and destroy their personal album records. Evaluation of the Ruby code in my app was nicely handled by the ERB library. 

 Working on the second of my portfolio projects was hugely beneficial in helping me cement the knowledge gained in the last module and to add another piece to the puzzle to my ever-growing  repository of web-developer skills.
