 It feels like it was yesterday when I went to visit FLS campus in London. The school was based in a multi-story building located near the Moorsgate underground station. 
 I was greeted by a friendly staff member eager to show me what the Flatiron software development program was all about. 

 The place was cosy and filled with a diverse group of students eager to learn a thing or two about coding ;).  I remember asking many questions about curriculum, the background of the FLS teacher’s and their approach to teaching. From the beginning I was impressed with responses that I was receiving and the unique approach taken by the school to teaching such a complicated and unique subject as coding. I was also pleased to hear about job opportunities that were waiting for the FLS graduates and their impressive track record in the amount of graduates that were getting job offers within the 6 months of the graduation.

During this visit I have made my final decision to enroll in the program and switch my career from online marketing to software development. I have now reached the final steps of my journey and  after looking back and reminiscing those sleepless nights and hectoliters of coffee drunk by me in order to stay awake and maintain a strong focus on the ultimate goal of becoming a full-stack web developer, I can safely say that it was all worth it. The program was challenging yet rewarding, it enhanced my problem solving abilities and helped me develop a brand new set of skills needed to become a well-rounded backend software developer. I am looking forward to opening a brand new chapter in my life, and to many new problems that I will get to solve….
