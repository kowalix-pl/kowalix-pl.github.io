Learning a new foreign language is a daunting task even for those that consider themselves well prepared for it, but learning a new coding language from scratch is a totally different ball game. There are the new alien words to learn, language syntaxes out of this planet, methods, iterations and loops that can make your head spin. In the beginning everything seems simple but as our program develops and we get introduced to even more advanced topics, we may find ourselves in front of the proverbial wall. During those dark moments in our lives, we cannot lose sight of our ultimate goal, we have to push forward, look for new explanations of the topic online and offline, so that we could finally get a good grasp on the subject and get to the finish line of the course. 

There are few of my daily rituals that  I would like to share with you that helped me on this challenging, yet rewarding journey of learning to code on FLS program and moving my lifelong dream of becoming a full-stack software engineer: 

* Dedicate a certain amount of time for your study.
* Prepare your learning space and make sure that there is no clutter on your desk and that there are no other distractions that could negatively impact your daily learning goals.
* Use pomodoro technique to schedule and manage breaks. 
* Take good notes (I recommend mind-mapping here), and break down complex ideas into small components.
* Keep track of your progress in a diary, and make notes of the coding solutions that were difficult to get a grasp on.
* Do not be afraid to utilize the AAQ feature that FLS provides for you and ask questions to your cohort via slack. This community rocks
* Engage in some sport and meditate daily in order to keep your blood level low. 
* And last, but not least have fun doing it :)

See you all on the other side, future full-stack developers.
