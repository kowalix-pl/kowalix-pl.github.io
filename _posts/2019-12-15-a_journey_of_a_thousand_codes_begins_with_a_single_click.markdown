Since I can remember I have always been interested in learning new and exciting things. I wanted to create new items from scratch or reverse-engineer the old ones. Hence most of my toys ended up somewhere in the corner of my room disassembled and left waiting to become parts for my new “project/adventure”.
 
 Fast forward to my adult life, I chose online marketing as a career and worked in that field for a number of years, but I begun to feel that something was missing and that there is something better  I could do with my life, as I did not feel fulfilled and happy in my work environment and the job stopped giving me the same satisfaction as it did when I first started. Somewhere in my heart of hearts, I knew that I needed a career change, and I needed it fast. So I made a decision to take massive action and change my state of affairs by looking at possible career move options.
 
  I narrowed down my search to the top 3 topics that I thought were a good match for my passion, character and the progression in my career that I wanted to see. Those were project management, data science, and software development. I weighed the pros and cons for all of the above and quickly determined that only the software development would fulfill my dream of “making the world better with the application of technology”. I want to be able to get my “creative juices flowing” and learn how to create something out of nothing. Deliver software solutions that people can appreciate and use every day. 

 Over the past several months I have spent a considerable amount of time watching videos posted by people working in that field. I gathered data about possible ways of breaking in. I decided that software dev. Bootcamp would be the way to go, as it reduces my learning curve and armors me with the applicable skills. And here is where I am now…. ready to start writing the next chapter in my book of life.
