My third project at Flatiron school program, an Online Repository of Programming Languages, was built using a web application with Rails, a popular and powerful web framework built on the Ruby programming language that such online powerhouses like GitHub, Twitter, Shopify, Hulu, and Basecamp were built on.

There are several reasons why some of the most known websites and applications were built using Ruby on rails framework:

* It is a cost-effective solution.

* The Ruby on Rails framework is 100% free and it runs on an open source framework.

* It is based on MVC - Model-View-Controller architecture that splits responsibilities of the section into 3 distinctive parts that manage different things. 

* Model is in charge of the application data, views displays results to the end-user and controller represents intermediary between models and views.

* It is an easy to manage, flexible and secure solution.

* There are large libraries of gems that speed up the development process.

My first real-life experience with this framework was very positive. Rails turbo-charged my application creation process with its built in generators that easily created out-of-the-box backbone for the app. The rails console facilitated interaction with the application from the command line, and proved indispensable during code testing and data server-side changes. The rails routes command, on the other hand, gave me access to the data of all defined routes, which was very useful for tracking down routing problems in my app. The above listed factors combined provide validation for this framework and its usability in speedy creation of applications of all sizes and complexity. It is an agile framework equipped with many tools that simplify application development processes and I would definitely recommend it to people who embarked on their own  journey of becoming software developers.
