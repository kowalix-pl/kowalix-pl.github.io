JavaScript is the language that powers the web. It brings the website to life by managing animations and enabling real user interaction. Without it, our modern-day websites would look like static, unengaging relicts of the past. 

Therefore i chose this language to power frontend of my fourth project at FLS, `JamesQuiz` - an interactive quiz application for aspiring software developers. 

The main components of my program related to JS were:

* `backendAPI.js` - that manages `communication` with the backend.
* `htmlCreator.js - that handles dynamic creation of HTML components required to run the quiz.
* `page.js` - that stores the `WelcomePage`, `QuestionsPage` and `ResultsPage` classes and manages the logic of the one-page app related to showing and hiding pages
* And last, but not least `script.js’ - controls the flow of the program by managing user interaction with it.

**JavaScript** proved invaluable in the dynamic, flawless generation of the quiz components and managing the seamless flow of the program. Despite the fact that this language has been developed over ¼ of a century ago, it is constantly evolving without  ever losing its popularity in the software development community. In the recent article published by the TechGig* JavaScript was listed as one of the top 5 languages to learn in 2021 and due to its versatility I would highly recommend this language to everyone who is thinking about a career in web-development.
